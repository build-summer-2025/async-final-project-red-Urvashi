This is my project based on Gender Biases and Women in stem. The data was taken from kaggle and here is the link to my data set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gmudit/employer-data

The data shows that, across departments, men and women in this company are represented almost equally, with only slight male skews in Finance, Product, and Sales. In STEM-related fields such as Engineering, the gender balance is particularly close to even, challenging the stereotype that women are absent from technical spaces. Education, experience, and age are nearly identical across genders, which means women are entering with the same qualifications and staying just as long as men.

When it comes to salaries, the gaps that exist are small and inconsistent: sometimes men earn more, sometimes women do. Within the same job title, pay is nearly identical, which suggests that explicit salary discrimination is not widespread here. Instead, the subtler bias shows up in patterns, for example, Finance and Product (fields closely linked to STEM and leadership) tilt male, and in Marketing men are paid noticeably more. Women’s higher averages in Sales and at the PhD level show that when barriers are lowered, women can even outpace men.

Final thought: The data challenges the idea that women “don’t belong” in STEM by showing they are equally qualified and successful. Yet, the small, uneven gaps remind us that gender bias doesn’t vanish on its own; it must be continually addressed through conscious practices, especially in STEM departments where women’s representation has historically been questioned.
